# simple-web-c

Simple webserver written in C to start hacking around sockets and HTTP

The idea is to start with a simple webserver and then move forward to building a proxy.

Will start using normal sockets and threads. Then incrementally add more advance features and performance improvements, EPOLL, kqueue, etc.
